Third year final project - The Robot Shopkeeper

This is my third year project, aiming to develop an integrated robotics system using a Baxter robot to allow Baxter to be able to run a sweet shop and respond to customers.

The code provided will be separated into different catkin packages, so that each section of the software can be run individually. For now, the sections are manipulation and perception, which will be further expanded upon later.
