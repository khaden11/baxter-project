The aim of this project is to produce a piece of software using the robotic operating system (ROS) that will allow Baxter to interact with people and give them sweets within a shop-like setting. The personal aim of this project is to learn the algorithms and software systems used in autonomous systems whilst doing this project. Practically, the aim is to allow the School of Computing to be able to use this system as an interactive shopkeeper demonstration on Open Days.
