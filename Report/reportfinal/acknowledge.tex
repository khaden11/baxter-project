Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Mehmet Dogar, who gave me very useful advice throughout all of our meetings and really inspired me in many stages of the project. We met on a very regular basis and it helped a lot to be able to discuss ideas and theories with him to help me get a more clear idea of ways I could implement things. I would also like to thank Dr. Anthony Cohn, who acted as a secondary supervisor. He has helped guide me and Mehmet throughout this entire process. Another person I couldn't have done without was Muhannad, one of the PhD students in the robotics lab. His knowledge of Baxter, the Kinect and robotics in general was key when I started this project. Without his help I would've been stuck on some features for a lot longer.

I would also like to thank Dr Mark Walkley, who is my assessor for this project. Throughout the scoping and planning document and the presentation, he gave invaluable insight and opinions on my ideas for the project.
\newline\newline
I thank my amazing fianc\'{e}e for putting up with me over this three month period, especially towards the end, where I have no doubt put her through many nights of stress and worrying.
\newline\newline
Finally, I need to thank Baxter for not malfunctioning too badly throughout the project. I have only had one broken Kinect stand and a stuck gripper motor but overall, he has stayed in one piece.
